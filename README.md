This is a port of [my personal site](https://tymick.me) (a static site built with Next.js and React) to WordPress, my first attempt to acquaint myself with the WordPress ecosystem. Try opening up the original in a separate window and comparing the two side by side—I think the family resemblance is pretty good!

I started by spinning up a new WordPress installation at [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com), then recreated the content of each of my pages, blog posts, and menus in the WordPress dashboard, then forked Automattic’s [\_s theme](https://underscores.me), recreated my site’s Bootstrap design as close as possible, and finally deleted everything from \_s I didn’t end up needing to make the package as minimal as possible. Oh, and uploaded the final theme to this WordPress installation, and here we are looking it it today!

This project involved a lot of PHP for the template files, used Sass for stylesheet preprocessing, implemented Bootstrap’s responsive font sizing, and got me acquainted with the WordPress Loop. It was really fascinating, having come from the JavaScript world, seeing firsthand how similar a product it’s possible to create using such vastly different tools.

Thanks for checking this out, and [let me know](https://ty-mick-wordpress-port.000webhostapp.com/connect) if you have any questions!

Sincerely,<br />
